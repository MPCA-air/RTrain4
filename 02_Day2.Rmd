## Schedule  {-}

<div class="well" style="margin-left: 322px;">

- Review Day 1
- The `ggplot()` sandwich
- Explore your `data frame`
- Arrange and filter data
- **Guess Who!** - The Star Wars edition

</div>


<br>

## Review  {-}
<hr>

- We kicked off with a tour of RStudio.


![](images/rstudio.png){style="width: 74%; margin-left: 12.5%;"}

<br>

- Then learned to:
    - Store values
    - Name objects
    - Remove objects 
- Made lists with `c("item 1", "item 2", "item 3")`
- Combined multiple lists into a tidy table
    - R calls these `data frames`
  
<br>
  

![](images/vector_to_dataframe.png){width="50%" style="margin-left: 8%;"}


<br>

- Installed **NEW** packages

![](images/readr-hexbin-sticker-from-rstudio.png){width="145" style="float: left; margin-right: 12px; margin-left: 8%; margin-bottom: 12px;"}

<br>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

- Read data from online using `read_csv()`
- Used the `ggplot()` function to make our first plot 

  
<br>


## Example workflow {-}

Here's an example air monitoring project from start to finish. 

<br>

<details>
<summary class = "btn_code"> __EXAMPLE__ - Ozone data project </summary>
<div class="quiz" style="margin-top: 0; background-color: white;">
<p>
<br>

Imagine we just received 3 years worth of ozone monitoring data to summarize. __Fun!__ Below is an example workflow we might follow using R.

### 0. Start a new project {-}

Let's be creative and name our project: `"2019_Ozone"`

```{r create, include=F, echo=F, eval=F}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

# Prepare example data
aqs <- read_excel("data/2014_AQS_FondduLac.xlsx") %>%
       mutate(Date = as.Date(Date))

met <- read_csv("data/COQ 2014 Processed MET -ASOS.csv") %>% 
       mutate(Date  = as.Date(paste(Year, Month, Day, sep = "-")),
              Month = as.numeric(Month),
              Hour  = as.numeric(Hour)) %>% 
       group_by(Date, Month, Day, Hour) %>% 
       summarize(TEMP_F = mean(TempF, na.rm = T))

aqs <- left_join(aqs, met)

aqs <- filter(aqs, Parameter == 88101, !is.na(TEMP_F))

aqs <- rename(aqs, OZONE = Conc, YEAR = Year, SITE = site_catid) %>%
       rowwise() %>%
       mutate(YEAR = 2017 - sample(-1:1, 1),
              Date = as.Date(paste(YEAR, Month, Day, sep = "-")))

aqs <- aqs %>%
       select(SITE, Date, Hour, OZONE, TEMP_F, everything()) %>%
       filter(Month > 3, Month < 11) %>% 
       group_by(SITE, Date) %>%
       mutate(OZONE  = max(OZONE, na.rm = T),
              TEMP_F = max(TEMP_F, na.rm = T)) %>% 
       slice(1)

aqs$UNITS <- "PPB"

aqs$UNITS[6] <- "PPM"
aqs$OZONE[6] <- aqs$OZONE[6] / 1000

write_csv(aqs, "data/OZONE_samples_demo.csv")
```


### 1. Read the data {-}
```{r data, message=F, warning=F}
library(readr)

# Read a file from the web
air_data <- read_csv("https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/OZONE_samples_demo.csv")
```

```{r tbl, echo=F}
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)

air_data %>% sample_n(5) %>% select(SITE, Date, OZONE, TEMP_F) %>% kable()
```


### 2. Clean the names {-}
```{r clean-names, message=F, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
library(janitor)

# Capital letters and spaces make things more difficult
# Let's clean them out
air_data <- clean_names(air_data)
```


### 3. Plot the data {-}
```{r view, message=F, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(air_data, aes(x = temp_f, y = ozone)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


### 4. Clean the data {-}
```{r clean, eval=T}
library(dplyr)

# Drop values out of range
air_data <- air_data %>% filter(ozone > 0, temp_f < 199) 

# Convert all samples to PPB
air_data <- air_data %>% 
            mutate(OZONE = ifelse(units == "PPM", ozone * 1000, 
                                  ozone)) 
```


### 5. View the data __closer__ {-}
```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
ggplot(air_data, aes(x = temp_f, y = ozone)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.2, size = 3) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
    facet_wrap(~site) +
    labs(title = "Ozone increases with temperature", 
         subtitle = "Observations from 2015-2017")
```


### 6. Summarize the data {-}
```{r summary}
air_data <- air_data %>% 
            group_by(site, year) %>% 
            summarize(avg_ozone = mean(ozone) %>% round(2),
                      avg_temp  = mean(temp_f) %>% round(2))
```


```{r, echo=F}
air_data %>% kable()
```


###  7. Save the results {-}

__Save the final data table__
```{r save-csv, eval=F}
air_data %>% write_csv("results/2015-17_ozone_summary.csv")
```


<br>

__Save the site plot to PDF__
```{r save-pdf, eval=F}
ggsave("results/2015-2017 - Ozone vs Temp.pdf")
```


### 8. Share with friends {-}

<div class="well">
Having an exact record of what you did can be great documentation for yourself and others. It's also handy when you want to repeat the same analysis on new data. Then you only need to copy the script, update the read data line, and push run to get a whole new set of fancy charts.

## Back to Jakku! {-}

![](images/moving_on.jpg){style="margin-left: 12%; margin-bottom: 10px; width: 75%"}


# A new day {-}
<hr>

Let's start fresh with a new R script.

__OPEN a new R script__

- __File > New File > R Script__
- Click the _floppy disk_ save icon
- Give it a name: `day2.R` will work well

<br>

__Load the `readr` package from our library__
```{r, eval=T, message=F}
library(readr)
```

<br>

__Read the scrap data from the web__
```{r starwars_csv_name, eval=T, message=F}
# Read in scrap data and set name to "scrap"
scrap <- read_csv("https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/starwars_scrap_jakku.csv")
```



## Plot the scrap data {-}

Last time we made a column plot showing the amount of scrap coming from each origin city.
```{r, fig.width=12}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(scrap, aes(y = amount, x = origin)) + 
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Which origin sold the most scrap?") 
```

<br>

<div class="well">
Let's break this down into its main ingredients and get to know `ggplot()`.
</div>

# | Plots with _ggplot2_
<hr>

#### _Plot the data, Plot the data, Plot the data_ {-}

<br>

![](images/ggplot2_hex.png){align="right" width="180" style="margin-right: 70px; margin-top: -124px;"}


## The `ggplot()` sandwich {-}


![](images/auto_plot.gif){style="margin-top: -22px; margin-left: -40px; max-width: 110%;"}

<h5 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -42px;"> A `ggplot` has 3 ingredients. </h5>


## 1. The base plot {-}
```{r, echo = T, eval = T}
library(ggplot2)
```



```{r, echo=T, eval=T}
ggplot(scrap)
```

<br>

> we load the package `library (ggplot2)`, but the function to make a plot is `ggplot(scrap)`. 


## 2. The the X, Y _aesthetics_  {-}

The _aesthetics_ assign the components from the data that you want to use in the chart. These also determine the dimensions of the plot.

```{r, eval = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = amount)) 
```


## 3. The layers or _geometries_  {-}
```{r, eval = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = amount)) + geom_col()
```

<br>

## Colors {-}
<hr>


Now let's change the fill color to match the origin.
```{r, eval = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = amount, fill = origin)) +
  geom_col() 
```

<br>

<div class="tip">
### <i class="fa fa-cogs" aria-hidden="true" style="color: green"></i> EXERCISE {-}

Try making a scatterplot of any two columns.

_Hint: Numeric variables will be more informative._

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = column1, y = column2 )) + geom_point()
```
</div>

# Data exploration {-} 

# | dplyr
<hr>

![](images/dplyr_hex.png){width="128" align="left" style="margin-right: 32px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;"}

<br>

The _dplyr_ package is our go-to tool for exploring, re-arranging, and summarizing data. Use `install.packages("dplyr")` to add _dplyr_ to your library.  

<div style="clear: both; margin-top: 22px;"></div>

## Functions to get to know your data. {-}

| Function | Information             |  
|:------|:---------------------------|  
| `names(scrap)`  | column names            |  
| `nrow(...)`     | number of rows          |  
| `ncol(...)`     | number of columns       | 
| `summary(...)`  | summary of all column values (ex. _max_, _mean_, _median_)  | 
| `glimpse(...)`  | column names + a glimpse of first values (requires _dplyr_ package)   |  


# | `glimpse()` the columns
<hr>

Use the `glimpse()` function to find out what type and how much data you have.

Use the `summary()` function to get a quick report on your numeric data.

<br><br>

### Let's give these a whirl. {-}

```{r glimpse, warning = F, message = F}
library(dplyr)

# View the first few values & the type of data each column contains
glimpse(scrap)
```

```{r summary-scrap, warning = F, message = F}
# Use the summary function to get a quick of idea of means and maxima for your numeric data
summary(scrap)
```

```{r summary-try, eval=F}

# Try the rest on your own - be BRAVE!

nrow()

ncol()

names()

```

<br>

## More `dplyr` {-}

`dplyr` is our go-to package for most analysis tasks. With the six functions below you can accomplish just about anything you'd want to do with data.

<br>

> ### <i class="fa fa-toolbox" aria-hidden="true" style="color: grey;"></i> Your new analysis toolbox  {-}
>
> | Function      | Job                                                 |  
> |:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------|  
> | `select()`    | Select individual columns to drop or keep           |  
> | `arrange()`   | Sort a table top-to-bottom based on the values of a column |  
> | `filter()`    | Keep only a subset of rows depending on the values of a column      | 
> | `mutate()`    | Add new columns or update existing columns          | 
> | `summarize()` | Calculate a single summary for an entire table     |   
> | `group_by()`  | Sort data into groups based on the values of a column  |  



# | Porg tables 

A poggle of porgs has volunteered to help us demo the `dplyr` functions. 

```{r porg-tabs, results='asis', echo=F}
cat(readLines("porg_tabs.txt"))
```


# | `select()`
<hr>

Use the `select()` function to:

- Drop a column you no longer need
- Pull-out a few columns to create a new table
- Rearrange or change the order of columns



## Drop columns with a minus sign: `-column_name` {-}
```{r select, warning = F, message = F}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

scrap <- read_csv("https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/starwars_scrap_jakku.csv")

# Drop the destination column
select(scrap, -destination)
```


## Keep only three columns {-}
```{r arrange3, warning = F, message = F}

# Keep the item, amount and price_per_pound columns
select(scrap, c(item, amount, price_per_pound))
```


## `everything()` {-}

`select()` also works to change the order of columns. The code below puts the `item` column first and then moves the `units` and `amount` columns directly after `item`. We then keep `everything()` else the same. 

```{r select44, warning = F, message = F}

# Make the `item`, `units`, and `amount` columns the first three columns
# Leave `everything()` else in the same order
select(scrap, item, units, amount, everything()) 
```



# | `arrange()` 
<hr>

Rey wants to know what the highest priced items are. Use `arrange()` to find the highest priced scrap item and see which origins might have a lot of them.

```{r select-arrange-price, warning = F}
# Arrange scrap items by price
scrap <- arrange(scrap, price_per_pound)

# View the top 6 rows
head(scrap)
```

<br>

### Only `145 credits`! That's not very much at all, oh wait... {-}


## Put **BIG** things first: `desc()` {-}
<hr>

To arrange a column in descending order with the biggest numbers on top, we use: `desc(price_per_pound)`

```{r desc-arrange, warning = F}
# Put most expensive items on top
scrap <- arrange(scrap, desc(price_per_pound))

# View the top 8 rows
head(scrap, 8)
```


<br>

<div class="tip">
### <i class="fa fa-bicycle" aria-hidden="true" style="color: green"></i> Exercise {-}

Try arranging by more than one column, such as `price_per_pound` and `amount`. What happens?

__HINT:__ You can view the entire table by clicking on it in the upper-right _Environment_ tab.

<br>
</div>

<br>


<div class="well">
### <i class="fas fa-user-astronaut" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip! {-}

When you save an arranged data table it maintains its order. This is perfect for sending people a quick __Top 10__ list of pollutants or sites.

</div>

<br>

# | `filter()`
<hr>

The `filter()` function creates a subset of the data based on the value of one or more columns. Let's take a look at the records with the origin `"All"`.

```{r filter12, eval=T}
filter(scrap, origin == "All")
```


<br>



<div class="well">
### <i class="fas fa-user-astronaut" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip! {-}

Use a `==` (double equals sign) for comparing values. A `==` makes the comparison "is it equal to?" and returns a True or False answer. So the code above returns all the rows where the condition `origin == "All"` is TRUE.

A single equals sign `=` is used within functions to set options, for example `read_csv(file = "starwars_scrap_jakku.csv")`. Don't worry too much. If you use the wrong symbol R is often helpful and will let you know which one is needed.

</div>

## Comparisons {-}
<hr>

Processing data requires many types of filtering. You'll want to know how to select observations in your table by making various comparisons.

<br>

__Key comparison operators__

| Symbol| Comparison               |
|:------|:-------------------------|
| `>`   | greater than             |
| `>=`  | greater than or equal to |
| `<`   | less than                |
| `<=`  | less than or equal to    |
| `==`  | equal to                 |
| `!=`  | NOT equal to             |
| `%in%`| is value in a list: `X %in% c(1,3,5)` |
| `is.na(...)`  | Is the value missing? |

<br>

<div class="tip">
### <i class="fa fa-bicycle" aria-hidden="true" style="color: green"></i> Exercise {-}

Try comparing some things in the console and see if you get what you'd expect. R doesn't always think like we do.

```{r, eval=F}

4 != 5

4 == 4

4 < 3

4 > c(1, 3, 5)

5 == c(1, 3, 5)

5 %in% c(1, 3, 5)

2 %in% c(1, 3, 5)

2 == NA
```
</div>


## Dropping rows {-}

Let's look at the data without that pesky _All_ category. Look in the comparison table above to find the `NOT` operator. We're going to filter the data to keep only the origins that are `NOT equal to` "All".

<br>

```{r filter-all}
scrap <- filter(scrap, origin != "All")
```


<br>

We can arrange the data in ascending order by `item` to confirm that the "All" category is gone.

```{r filter-arrange, message=F, warning=F}

# Arrange data
scrap <- arrange(scrap, item)

head(scrap)

```

<br>

Now let's take another look at that bar chart. Is there anything else that is less than perfect with our data?

```{r ggplot-noAll}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = amount)) + geom_col()
``` 



## Multiple filters {-}
<hr>

We can add multiple comparisons to `filter()` to further restrict the data we pull from a larger data set. Only the records that pass the conditions of all the comparisons will be pulled into the new data frame. 

The code below filters the data to only scrap records with an origin of `Outskirts` __AND__ a destination of `Niima Outpost`.

```{r filter-multi, eval=F}

outskirts_to_niima <- filter(scrap, 
                             origin        == "Outskirts", 
                             destination   == "Niima Outpost")
```


<br>
<br>

# Guess Who? {-}
<h2 style="margin-top: -24px;"> _Star Wars edition_ </h2>

![](images/sw_guesswho.jpg){width="280" align="right" style="margin-top: -65px; margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 8px;"}

> Are you the best Jedi detective out there? Let's play a game and find out. 

<br>

Guess what else comes with the `dplyr` package? A **Star Wars data set**.

You can open the data set with the following steps:

1. Load the `dplyr` package from your `library()`
1. Pull the Star Wars dataset into your environment.
    

```{r}
library(dplyr)

starwars_data <- starwars
```


## <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Rules </span> {-}

1. You have a __secret__ identity.
1. Scroll through the Star Wars dataset and find a character you find interesting. _(Or run `sample_n(starwars_data, 1)` to choose your character at random.)_
1. __Keep it hidden!__ Don't show your neighbor the character you chose.
1. Take turns asking each other questions about your partner's Star Wars character. 
1. Use the answers to build a `filter()` function and narrow down the potential characters your neighbor may have picked. 


For example: Here's a `filter()` statement that filters the data to the character _Plo Koon_.

<div style="width: 90%; margin-left: 8%">
```{r, eval=F}
mr_koon <- filter(starwars_data,
                  mass       < 100,
                  eye_color  != "blue",
                  gender     == "male",
                  homeworld  == "Dorin",
                  birth_year > 20)

```
</div>
<br>

Elusive answers are allowed. For example, if someone asks: _What is your character's mass?_ 

- You can respond: _My character's mass is equal to one less than their age._ 
- Or if you're feeling generous you can give a straight forward answer such as: _My character's mass is definitely more than 100 and less that 140._

Sometimes a character will not have a specific attribute. We learned earlier how R stores nulls as `NA`. If your character has a missing value for hair color, one of your filter statements could be `is.na(hair_color)`.

### __Back to Jakku__

Let's calculate some new columns to help focus Rey's scavenging work.

</div>

# | `mutate()`
<hr>

`mutate() ` can edit existing columns in a data frame or add new values that are calculated from existing columns.


## Add a column {-}

First, let's add a column with our names. That way Rey can thank us personally when her ship is finally up and running. 
```{r mutate-1, warning=F, message=F}
# Add your name as a column
scrap <- mutate(scrap, scrap_finder = "BB8")

```


## Add several columns {-}

Let's also add a new column to document the data measurement method.

```{r mutate2columns, echo=T, eval=T}
#  Add your name as a column and
#  some information about the method
scrap <- mutate(scrap, 
                scrap_finder    = "BB8",
                measure_method  = "REM-24")

## REM = Republic Equivalent Method
```


## Change a column  {-}
<hr>

Remember how the units of Tons was written two ways: "TONS" and "Tons"? We can use `mutate()` together with `tolower()` to make sure all of the scrap units are written in lower case. This will help prevent them from getting grouped separately in our plots and summaries.

```{r mutate-2000}

# Set units to all lower-case
scrap <- mutate(scrap, units = tolower(units))

# toupper() changes all of the letters to upper-case.
```


## Add calculated columns {-}

In our work we often use `mutate` to convert units for measurements. In this case, let's estimate the total pounds for the scrap items that are reported in tons. 


### Tons `to` Pounds conversion {-}

We can use `mutate()` to convert the `amount` column to pounds. Multiply the `amount` column by 2000 to get new values for a column named `amount_lbs`.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}

scrap_pounds <- mutate(scrap, amount_lbs = amount * 2000)
```


<br>

## Final stretch! {-}

We now have all the tools we need. To get her ship working, Rey is trying to track down more of the scrap item: `Ion engine`. 

__Step 1:__

- __filter__ the data to only `Ion engine`

<br>

<details>
<summary class = "btn_code_blue">_Show code_</summary>

<p>

```{r, warning=F, message=F}

# Grab only the items named "Ion engine"
scrap_pounds <- filter(scrap_pounds, item == "Ion engine")

```
</p>
</details>

<br><br>

<hr>

Now, arrange the data in descending order of pounds so Rey knows where the highest amount of `Ion engine` scrap comes from. 

__Step 2:__

- __arrange__ in descending order by `amount_lbs`


<br>

<details>
<summary class="btn_code_blue"> _Show code_ </summary>
<p>

## First mission complete! {-}
Nice work! 

Rey got a great deal on her engines and even traded in some scrap for spending cash.

# | Save data

You can't break your original dataset if you always name it something else. Let's use the `readr` package to save our new CSV with the tons converted to pounds.

```{r write-csv1, eval=F}
# Save data as a CSV file 
write_csv(scrap_pounds, "scrap_in_pounds.csv")
```

<br>

> Where did R save the file? 

Let's create a new `results/` folder to keep our processed data separate from any raw data we receive.

```{r write-csv2, eval=F}
# Save data as a CSV file to results folder
write_csv(scrap_pounds, "results/scrap_in_pounds.csv")
```

# New mission available {-}
<hr>

BB8 received new data from the wookies suggesting there was a large magnetic storm before `Site 1` burned down on Endor. Sounds like we're going to be __STORM CHASERS__ tomorrow. Mission accepted.
