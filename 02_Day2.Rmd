## Review Day 1 {-}
<hr>

- We kicked off with a tour of RStudio.


![](images/rstudio.png){style="width: 74%; margin-left: 12.5%;"}

<br>

- And jumped into storing values, naming objects, and how to remove objects from the environment.
- We made lists with `c()`
- We brought lists together into a table, also known as a `data frame` or `tibble`.

## Example workflow {-}

Here's an example air monitoring project from start to finish. 

<details>
<summary class = "btn_code"> __EXAMPLE__  Ozone data project </summary>
<div class="quiz" style="margin-top: 0; background-color: white;">
<p>
<br>

Imagine we just received 3 years worth of ozone monitoring data to summarize. __Fun!__ Below is an example workflow we might follow using R.

### 0. Start a new project {-}

Let's be creative and name our project: `"2019_Ozone"`

```{r create, include=F, echo=F, eval=F}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

# Prepare example data
aqs <- read_excel("data/2014_AQS_FondduLac.xlsx") %>%
       mutate(Date = as.Date(Date))

met <- read_csv("data/COQ 2014 Processed MET -ASOS.csv") %>% 
       mutate(Date  = as.Date(paste(Year, Month, Day, sep = "-")),
              Month = as.numeric(Month),
              Hour  = as.numeric(Hour)) %>% 
       group_by(Date, Month, Day, Hour) %>% 
       summarize(TEMP_F = mean(TempF, na.rm = T))

aqs <- left_join(aqs, met)

aqs <- filter(aqs, Parameter == 88101, !is.na(TEMP_F))

aqs <- rename(aqs, OZONE = Conc, YEAR = Year, SITE = site_catid) %>%
       rowwise() %>%
       mutate(YEAR = 2017 - sample(-1:1, 1),
              Date = as.Date(paste(YEAR, Month, Day, sep = "-")))

aqs <- aqs %>%
       select(SITE, Date, Hour, OZONE, TEMP_F, everything()) %>%
       filter(Month > 3, Month < 11) %>% 
       group_by(SITE, Date) %>%
       mutate(OZONE  = max(OZONE, na.rm = T),
              TEMP_F = max(TEMP_F, na.rm = T)) %>% 
       slice(1)

aqs$UNITS <- "PPB"

aqs$UNITS[6] <- "PPM"
aqs$OZONE[6] <- aqs$OZONE[6] / 1000

write_csv(aqs, "data/OZONE_samples_demo.csv")
```


### 1. Read the data {-}
```{r data, message=F, warning=F}
library(readr)

# Read a file from the web
air_data <- read_csv("https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/OZONE_samples_demo.csv")
```

```{r tbl, echo=F}
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)

air_data %>% sample_n(5) %>% select(SITE, Date, OZONE, TEMP_F) %>% kable()
```


### 2. Clean the names {-}
```{r clean-names, message=F, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
library(janitor)

# Capital letters and spaces make things more difficult
# Let's clean them out
air_data <- clean_names(air_data)
```


### 3. Plot the data {-}
```{r view, message=F, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(air_data, aes(x = temp_f, y = ozone)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


### 4. Clean the data {-}
```{r clean, eval=T}
library(dplyr)

# Drop values out of range
air_data <- air_data %>% filter(ozone > 0, temp_f < 199) 

# Convert all samples to PPB
air_data <- air_data %>% 
            mutate(OZONE = ifelse(units == "PPM", ozone * 1000, 
                                  ozone)) 
```


### 5. View the data __closer__ {-}
```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
ggplot(air_data, aes(x = temp_f, y = ozone)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.2, size = 3) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
    facet_wrap(~site) +
    labs(title = "Ozone increases with temperature", 
         subtitle = "Observations from 2015-2017")
```


### 6. Summarize the data {-}
```{r summary}
air_data <- air_data %>% 
            group_by(site, year) %>% 
            summarize(avg_ozone = mean(ozone) %>% round(2),
                      avg_temp  = mean(temp_f) %>% round(2))
```


```{r, echo=F}
air_data %>% kable()
```


###  7. Save the results {-}

__Save the final data table__
```{r save-csv, eval=F}
air_data %>% write_csv("results/2015-17_ozone_summary.csv")
```


<br>

__Save the site plot to PDF__
```{r save-pdf, eval=F}
ggsave("results/2015-2017 - Ozone vs Temp.pdf")
```


### 8. Share with friends {-}

# Read scrap data {-}

It's time to jump back in to where we left off on __Day 1__.
```{r starwars_csv_name, eval=T, message=F}
# Read in scrap data and set name to "scrap"
scrap <- read_csv("https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/starwars_scrap_jakku.csv")
```

## Plot scrap data {-}

Last time we made a column plot showing the amount of scrap coming from each town.
```{r, fig.width=12}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(scrap, aes(y = amount, x = origin)) + 
  geom_col() +
  theme_gray()

```


# Data exploration {-} 

# | dplyr
<hr>

![](images/dplyr_hex.png){width="128" align="left" style="margin-right: 32px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;"}

<br>

The _dplyr_ package is our go-to tool for exploring, re-arranging, and summarizing data. Use `install.packages("dplyr")` to add _dplyr_ to your library.  

<div style="clear: both; margin-top: 22px;"></div>

## Functions to get to know your data. {-}

| Function | Information             |  
|:------|:---------------------------|  
| `names(scrap)`  | column names            |  
| `nrow(...)`     | number of rows          |  
| `ncol(...)`     | number of columns       | 
| `summary(...)`  | summary of all column values (ex. _max_, _mean_, _median_)  | 
| `glimpse(...)`  | column names + a glimpse of first values (requires _dplyr_ package)   |  


# | `glimpse()` the columns
<hr>

Use the `glimpse()` function to find out what type and how much data you have.

Use the `summary()` function to get a quick report on your numeric data.

<br><br>

### Let's read the data into R and give these a whirl. {-}

```{r glimpse, warning = F, message = F}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

scrap <- read_csv("https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/starwars_scrap_jakku.csv")

# View your whole dataframe and the types of data it contains
glimpse(scrap)
```

```{r summary-scrap, warning = F, message = F}
# Use the summary function to get a quick of idea of means and maxima for your numeric data
summary(scrap)
```

```{r summary-try, eval=F}

# Try the rest on your own, I dare you!

nrow()

ncol()

names()

```

<br>

## More dplyr {-}

Dplyr is our go-to package for most analysis tasks. With the six functions below you can accomplish just about anything you'd want to do with data.

<br>

> ### <i class="fa fa-toolbox" aria-hidden="true" style="color: grey;"></i> Your new analysis toolbox  {-}
>
> | Function      | Job                                                 |  
> |:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------|  
> | `select()`    | Select individual columns to drop or keep           |  
> | `arrange()`   | Sort a table top-to-bottom based on the values of a column |  
> | `filter()`    | Keep only a subset of rows depending on the values of a column      | 
> | `mutate()`    | Add new columns or update existing columns          | 
> | `summarize()` | Calculate a single summary for an entire table     |   
> | `group_by()`  | Sort data into groups based on the values of a column  |  



# | Porg tables 

A poggle of porgs has volunteered to help us demo the `dplyr` functions. 

```{r porg-tabs, results='asis', echo=F}
cat(readLines("porg_tabs.txt"))
```


# | `select()`
<hr>

Use the `select()` function to:

- Drop a column you no longer need
- Pull-out a few columns to create a new table
- Rearrange or change the order of columns



## Drop columns with a minus sign: `-column_name` {-}
```{r select, warning = F, message = F}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

scrap <- read_csv("https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/starwars_scrap_jakku.csv")

# Drop the destination column
select(scrap, -destination)
```


## Keep only three columns {-}
```{r arrange3, warning = F, message = F}

# Keep the item, amount and price_per_pound columns
select(scrap, c(item, amount, price_per_pound))
```


## `everything()` {-}

`select()` also works to change the order of columns. The code below puts the `item` column first and then moves the `units` and `amount` columns directly after `item`. We then keep `everything()` else the same. 

```{r select44, warning = F, message = F}

# Make the `item`, `units`, and `amount` columns the first three columns
# Leave `everything()` else in the same order
select(scrap, item, units, amount, everything()) %>% head()
```



# | `arrange()` 
<hr>

Rey wants to know what the highest priced items are. Use `arrange()` to find the highest priced scrap item and see which origins might have a lot of them.

```{r select-arrange-price, warning = F}
# Arrange scrap items by price
scrap <- arrange(scrap, price_per_pound)

# View the top 6 rows
head(scrap)
```

<br>

### Only `145 credits`! That's not very much at all, oh wait... {-}


## Big things first: `desc()`  {-}

To arrange a column in descending order with the biggest numbers on top, we use: `desc(price_per_pound)`

```{r desc-arrange, warning = F}
# Put most expensive items on top
scrap <- arrange(scrap, desc(price_per_pound))

# View the top 8 rows
head(scrap, 8)
```


<br>

<div class="data">
### <i class="fa fa-bicycle" aria-hidden="true" style="color: green"></i> Exercise {-}

Try arranging by more than one column, such as `price_per_pound` and `amount`. What happens?

__HINT:__ You can view the entire table by clicking on it in the upper-right _Environment_ tab.
</div>

<br>

### <i class="fas fa-user-astronaut" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip! {-}
<div class="well">

When you save an arranged data table it maintains its order. This is perfect for sending people a quick __Top 10__ list of pollutants or sites.

</div>

<br>

# | `filter()`
<hr>

The `filter()` function creates a subset of the data based on the value of one or more columns. Let's take a look at the records with the origin `"All"`.

```{r filter12, eval=T}
filter(scrap, origin == "All")
```


<br>

### <i class="fas fa-user-astronaut" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip! {-}

<div class="data">

Use a `==` (double equals sign) for comparing values. A `==` makes the comparison "is it equal to?" and returns a True or False answer. So the code above returns all the rows where the condition `origin == "All"` is TRUE.

A single equals sign `=` is used within functions to set options, for example `read_csv(file = "starwars_scrap_jakku.csv")`. Don't worry too much. If you use the wrong symbol R is often helpful and will let you know which one is needed.

</div>

## Comparisons {-}
<hr>

Processing data requires many types of filtering. You'll want to know how to select observations in your table by making various comparisons.

__Key comparison operators__

| Symbol| Comparison               |
|:------|:-------------------------|
| `>`   | greater than             |
| `>=`  | greater than or equal to |
| `<`   | less than                |
| `<=`  | less than or equal to    |
| `==`  | equal to                 |
| `!=`  | NOT equal to             |
| `%in%`| is value in a list: `X %in% c(1,3,5)` |
| `is.na(...)`  | Is the value missing? |

## <i class="fa fa-bicycle" aria-hidden="true" style="color: green"></i> Exercise {-}

Try comparing some things in the console and see if you get what you'd expect. R doesn't always think like we do.

```{r, eval=F}

4 != 5

4 == 4

4 < 3

4 > c(1, 3, 5)

5 == c(1, 3, 5)

5 %in% c(1, 3, 5)

2 %in% c(1, 3, 5)

2 == NA
```


## Dropping rows {-}

Let's look at the data without that pesky _All_ category. Look in the comparison table above to find the `NOT` operator. We're going to filter the data to keep only the origins that are `NOT equal to` "All".

<br>

```{r filter-all}
scrap <- filter(scrap, origin != "All")
```


<br>

We can arrange the data in ascending order by `item` to confirm that the "All" category is gone.

```{r filter-arrange, message=F, warning=F}

# Arrange data
scrap <- arrange(scrap, item)

head(scrap)

```

<br>

Now let's take another look at that bar chart. Is there anything else that is less than perfect with our data?

```{r ggplot-noAll}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = amount)) + geom_col()
``` 



## Multiple filters 
<hr>

We can add multiple comparisons to `filter()` to further restrict the data we pull from a larger data set. Only the records that pass the conditions of all the comparisons will be pulled into the new data frame. 

The code below filters the data to only scrap records with an origin of `Outskirts` __AND__ a destination of `Niima Outpost`.

```{r filter-multi, eval=F}

outskirts_to_niima <- filter(scrap, 
                             origin        == "Outskirts", 
                             destination   == "Niima Outpost")
```


<br>



# Guess Who? {-}
<h2 style="margin-top: -24px;"> _Star Wars edition_ </h2>

![](images/sw_guesswho.jpg){width="280" align="right" style="margin-top: -65px; margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 8px;"}

> Are you the best Jedi detective out there? Let's play a game to find out. 

<br>

Guess what else comes with the `dplyr` package? A **Star Wars data set**.

You can open the data set with the following steps:

1. Load the `dplyr` package from your `library()`
1. Pull the Star Wars dataset into your environment.
    

```{r}
library(dplyr)

starwars_data <- starwars
```


## <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Rules </span> {-}

1. You have a __secret__ identity.
1. Scroll through the Star Wars dataset and find a character you find interesting. _(Or run `sample_n(starwars_data, 1)` to choose your character at random.)_
1. __Keep it hidden!__ Don't show your neighbor the character you chose.
1. Take turns asking each other questions about your partner's Star Wars character. 
1. Use the answers to build a `filter()` function and narrow down the potential characters your neighbor may have picked. 


For example: Here's a `filter()` statement that filters the data to the character _Plo Koon_.

<div style="width: 90%; margin-left: 8%">
```{r, eval=F}
mr_koon <- filter(starwars_data,
                  mass       < 100,
                  eye_color  != "blue",
                  gender     == "male",
                  homeworld  == "Dorin",
                  birth_year > 20)

```
</div>
<br>

Elusive answers are allowed. For example, if someone asks: _What is your character's mass?_ 

- You can respond: _My character's mass is equal to one less than their age._ 
- Or if you're feeling generous you can give a straight forward answer such as: _My character's mass is definitely more than 100 and less that 140._

Sometimes a character will not have a specific attribute. We learned earlier how R stores nulls as `NA`. If your character has a missing value for hair color, one of your filter statements could be `is.na(hair_color)`. 

<br>

> Let's calculate some new columns to help focus Rey's scavenging work.


# | `mutate()`
<hr>

`mutate() ` can edit existing columns in a data frame or add new columns calculated from neighboring columns.

## Add a column {-}
<hr>

First, let's add a column with our names. That way Rey can thank us personally when her ship is finally up and running. 
```{r mutate-1, warning=F, message=F}
# Add your name as a column
scrap <- mutate(scrap, scrap_finder = "BB8")

```


## Add several columns {-}

Let's also add a new column to document the data measurement method.

```{r mutate2columns, echo=T, eval=T}
#  Add your name as a column and
#  some information about the method
scrap <- mutate(scrap, 
                scrap_finder    = "BB8",
                measure_method  = "REM-24")

## REM = Republic Equivalent Method
```


## Change a column  {-}
<hr>

Remember how the units of Tons was written two ways: "TONS" and "Tons"? We can use `mutate()` together with `tolower()` to make sure all of the scrap units are written in lower case. This will help prevent them from getting grouped separately in our plots and summaries.

```{r mutate-2000}

# Set units to all lower-case
scrap <- mutate(scrap, units = tolower(units))

# toupper() changes all of the letters to upper-case.
```


## Add calculated columns {-}

In our work we often use `mutate` to convert units for measurements. In this case, let's estimate the total pounds for the scrap items that are reported in tons. 


### Tons `to` Pounds conversion {-}

We can use `mutate()` to convert the `amount` column to pounds. Multiply the `amount` column by 2000 to get new values for a column named `amount_lbs`.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}

scrap_pounds <- mutate(scrap, amount_lbs = amount * 2000)
```


<br>

## Final stretch! {-}

<br>

It's time to get off this dusty planet and Rey needs an `Ion engine`. Let's __filter__ the data to only that type of item.

<br>

<details>
<summary class = "btn_code_blue">_Show code_</summary>

<p>

```{r, warning=F, message=F}

# Grab only the items named "Ion engine"
scrap_pounds <- filter(scrap_pounds, item == "Ion engine")

```
</p>
</details>

<br>

Arrange the data in descending order of pounds so Rey knows where the highest amount of scrap comes from. Then she can go there, trade for some discounted parts and __we're free to FLY TO ENDOR!__

<br>


<details>
<summary class="btn_code_blue"> _Show code_ </summary>
<p>
```{r arrange-final, eval=F, message=F, warning=F}

# Arrange data
scrap_pounds <- arrange(scrap_pounds, desc(amount_lbs))

# Return the origin of the highest amount_lbs of scrap
head(scrap_pounds, 1)

# Plot the total amount_lbs by origin
ggplot(scrap_pounds, aes(x = origin, y = amount_lbs)) + 
  geom_col()

```
</p>
</details>

## First mission complete! {-}


# | Save data

You can't break your original dataset if you always name it something else. Let's use the `readr` package to save our new CSV with the tons converted to pounds.

```{r write-csv1, eval=F}
# Save data as a CSV file 
write_csv(scrap_pounds, "scrap_in_pounds.csv")
```

<br>

> Where did R save the file? 

Let's create a new `results/` folder to keep our processed data separate from any raw data we receive.

```{r write-csv2, eval=F}
# Save data as a CSV file to results folder
write_csv(scrap_pounds, "results/scrap_in_pounds.csv")
```

While we're relaxing and flying to Endor let's get set up with our new data.

<a href="https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/air_endor.csv">
<span class="btn_code_blue" style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> __DOWNLOAD__  </span></a> -  Endor Air data

1. Download the data above.
1. Create a new folder called "data" in your project folder.
1. Move the Endor data to there.
1. Open a new R script called `endor_air.R`

Now we can read in the data from the data folder with our favorite `read_csv` function.

```{r, endor-air-read, eval=F}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)

air_endor <- read_csv("data/air_endor.csv")

names(air_endor)

# Clean the column names
air_endor <- clean_names(air_endor)

names(air_endor)
```

```{r, endor-air-read2, echo=F, message=F}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)

air_endor <- read_csv("https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/air_endor.csv")

air_endor <- clean_names(air_endor)

names(air_endor)
```

__NOTE__ 

When your project is open, RStudio sets the working directory to your project folder. When reading files from a folder outside of your project, you'll need to use the full file path location. 

For example: `X://Programs/Air_Quality/Ozone_data.csv`

# Welcome to Endor! {-}

<br>

__Let's get acquainted with our new Endor data set.__ 

__Remember the different ways?__

<br>

Hint: `summary()`, `glimpse()`, `nrow()`, `distinct`

<br>


```{r, endor-air2}

glimpse(air_endor)
```

<br>
```{r, dis}
distinct(air_endor, analyte)
```
<br>

__Woah. I see that there are many more analytes than we need. Lucky for us, we only want to know about `magnetic_field` data. Let's filter the data down to only that analyte.__ 

<br>

```{r, endor-air-filter}

mag_endor <- filter(air_endor, analyte == "magnetic_field")
```

<br>

> __Boom!__ How many rows are left now?

<br>


<div class="well">
With time series data it's helpful for R to know which column is the __date__ column. Dates come in many formats and the standard format in R is `2019-01-15`, also referred to as _Year-Month-Day_ format.

We'll use the `lubridate` package to help modify and format dates.
</div>


# | Dates 
<hr>

### The `lubridate` package {-}

![](images/lubridate.png){style="width: 21%; float: left; margin-right: 30px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"}


<br>

It's about time! Lubridate makes working with dates easier. 

We can find how much time has elapsed, add or subtract days, and find seasonal and day of the week averages. 

<br>

### Convert text to a *DATE* {-}

| Function    |  Order of date elements                                 |   
|----|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|  
|`mdy()  `    | Month-Day-Year :: `05-18-2019` or `05/18/2019`                 |  
|`dmy()  `    | Day-Month-Year (Euro dates) :: `18-05-2019` or `18/05/2019`    |  
|`ymd()  `    | Year-Month-Day (science dates) :: `2019-05-18` or `2019/05/18` |

### Get date parts {-}

| Function   |  Date element                                            |   
|----|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|  
|`year()  `  | Year          |  
|`month()`   | Month as _1,2,3_; For _Jan, Feb, Mar_ use `label=TRUE`  |  
|`day()`     | Day of the month  |  
|`wday()`    | Day of the week as _1,2,3_; For _Sun, Mon, Tue_ use `label=TRUE` |  
| _- Time -_   |            | 
|`hour() `   |  Hour of the day _(24hr)_ |  
|`minute() ` |  Minutes   |  
|`second() ` |  Seconds   |  
|`tz()  `    |  Time zone |

## Install `lubridate` {-}

First, type or copy and paste `install.packages("lubridate")` into RStudio.

## <i class="fa fa-broom" aria-hidden="true"></i> Clean the dates {-}

Let's use the `mdy()` function to turn the `start_run_date` column into a nicely formatted date.

```{r endor-air-mutate, message=F}
library(lubridate)

mag_endor <- mutate(mag_endor, date = mdy(start_run_date),
                               year = year(date))
```


<br>

__According to the request we received, the Resistance is only interested in observations from the year `2017`. So let's filter the data down to only dates within that year.__ 

<br>

```{r endor-air-filter-year}
mag_endor <- filter(mag_endor, year == "2017")
```


## Time series {-}
```{r endor-time, message=F}
ggplot(mag_endor, aes(x = date, y = result)) + 
  geom_line(size = 2, color = "tomato") + 
  geom_point(size = 5, alpha = 0.5)  # alpha changes transparency

```

Looks like the measurements definitely picked up a signal towards the end of the year. Let's make a different chart to show when this occurred. 


## Heatmap or calendar plot {-}

Sometimes with air data we want to know if there is seasonality in the data, this is also true for magnetic storm data from Endor. Calendar plots are great for this. 

We will use `ggplot()` and bring out the `geom_tile()` to organize our data by dates and find when and if that storm happened.

First, we'll pull more information out of the dates.

```{r, calendar_dates, fig.width=13, fig.height=7, out.width=1000}

mag_endor <- mutate(mag_endor, 
                    day_of_week   = wday(date, label = TRUE),
                    day_of_month  = mday(date),
                    week_of_month = day(date)/7, 
                    month         = month(date, label = TRUE))
```


```{r, calendar_year, fig.width=13, fig.height=7}
ggplot(mag_endor, aes(x = day_of_week, y = desc(week_of_month), fill = result)) +
  geom_tile(color = "gray") +
  geom_label(aes(label = day_of_month), size = 8, color = "white") +
  facet_wrap("month")
```

<br>


<div class="note">
## Mission complete! {-}

Aha! There really were high magnetic field readings in November. Hopefully, the _Resistance_ will reward us handsomely for this information.

# | The pipe operator

#### _...I wish I could type the name of the data frame less often._ {-}

<br>


![](images/pipe.png){style="margin-right: 20px; width: 136px; float: left;"}

__Now you can!__ 

We use the `%>%` to chain functions together and make our scripts more streamlined. We call it the _pipe_.

<br>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

Here are 2 examples of how the `%>%` operator is helpful. 

<br>

__`#1:`__ It eliminates the need for nested parentheses. 

Say you wanted to take the sum of 3 numbers and then take the log and then round the final result.
```{r maths, eval=F}
round(log(sum(c(10,20,30,40))))

```

<br>

The code doesn't look much like the words we used to describe it. Let's pipe it so we can read the code from left to right.
```{r maths_better, eval = F}
c(10,20,30,50) %>% sum() %>% log10() %>% round()
```

<br>

__`#2:`__ We can combine many processing steps into one cohesive chunk.

<br>

Here are some of the functions we've applied to the scrap data so far:

```{r review, eval=F}

scrap <- arrange(scrap, desc(price_per_pound))

scrap <- filter(scrap, origin != "All")

scrap <- mutate(scrap, 
                scrap_finder    = "BB8",
                measure_method  = "REM-24")
```

<br>


We can use the `%>%` operator and write it this way.

```{r review-better, eval=F}

scrap <- scrap %>%
           arrange(desc(price_per_pound)) %>%
           filter(origin != "All") %>%
           mutate(scrap_finder    = "BB8",
                  measure_method  = "REM-24")

```

<br>

<div class="tip">
### <i class="fa fa-bicycle" aria-hidden="true" style="color: green"></i> Exercise {-}

Similar to above, use the `%>%` to combine the two Endor lines below.

```{r better_endor, eval=F}

mag_endor <- filter(air_endor, analyte == "magnetic_field")

mag_endor <- mutate(mag_endor, date = mdy(start_run_date))

```
